# React.js Auth0 application

This application is an example of using Auth0 for autentication and usage of user scopes.

Once you run the application you will be able to either check the public page or sign up at Auth0 or sign in using your Google account. When you are logged in you will be able to see information exclusive for registered users.

Logging with a gmail account will automatically give you an admin role, thus, granting you access to exclusive content returned from the API.

## The Setup

Install the project with the necessary node_modules.

First, run the following code:

### `npm install`

Once the modules are properly installed, run the next code:

### `npm start`

This will make your browser open the URL http://localhost:3000

## Dependencies used:

- auth0
- express / express-jwt
- material-ui
